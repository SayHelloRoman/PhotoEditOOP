The program was written in Python using the following modules: pillow, os, sys, Tkinter.
\nAuthor: SayHelloRoman. This program was written to replace PhotoEdit 1.2 using OOP only.
\nPhotoEdit was my program for one contest, I wrote it for 3 days.
\nI hope this program will have good functionality and a good program will be published.
\nThe one who read this thanks to you and good luck.
